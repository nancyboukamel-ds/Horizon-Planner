# Horizon-Planner

Horizon Planner is a cutting-edge Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to eliminate the friction points in group travel planning. It is a Multi-Agent AI (MA-AI) system that seamlessly integrates trip itinerary generation with real-time geospatial and social features.

The project is built on a robust Hybrid Cloud Architecture, leveraging AWS for security and scalable data storage, and the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for advanced AI reasoning and world-class geospatial services (Google Maps Platform). This architecture is specifically designed to demonstrate advanced AI Engineering and MLOps principles.
